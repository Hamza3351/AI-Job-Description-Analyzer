I am a software engineer with 3 years of experience in Python and SQL. 
I have built ETL pipelines, used Docker and Kubernetes for containerized deployment, 
and deployed small-scale data applications on AWS. I am familiar with relational databases, 
basic CI/CD pipelines, and some cloud infrastructure tools. I have collaborated with small teams 
on several projects, focusing on data processing and analysis.
