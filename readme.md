## 🖥️ **How It Works**

### **1️⃣ Skill Extraction**
✔ Noun chunks  
✔ Entities  
✔ Token-based filtering  
✔ Normalization + cleaning  

---

### **2️⃣ Skill Matching (JD → Resume)**
Uses **RapidFuzz** token-sort ratio to compute:

- Match %
- Missing skills
- Matched pairs

---

### **3️⃣ AI Suggestion Generation**
Groq Llama 3.1 70B produces:

- 3 resume bullets (10–15 words)
- A strong headline
- A rationale explaining the match score

---

### **4️⃣ UI Presentation**
Streamlit displays:

- Extracted skills  
- Missing skills as colored badges  
- Match %  
- Resume score  
- AI recommendations  

---

## ▶️ **Run Locally**

### **Install Dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
---

### **Launch the Streamlit App**
```
streamlit run app.py
```
---

## 🔑 **Setup Groq API Key**
Login to your groq dashborad and then create new API key. Copy that key and then set it as an environment variable using:

### **Mac/Linux (bash/zsh)**
```
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" 
```
### **Windows Powershell**
```
setx GROQ_API_KEY "your_api_key_here" 
```

After that Then restart your terminal and verify:
```
echo $env:GROQ_API_KEY
```
